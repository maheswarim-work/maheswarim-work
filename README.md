# Hi, I'm Maheswari ðŸ‘‹

"Software Engineer | Independent AI Projects â€¢ APIs â€¢ Cloud | Python, Java, AWS, Azure, Snowflake, Databricks"

As a Software Engineering professional with a Masterâ€™s in Computer Science, I bring 12+ years of experience across industries such as commercial/specialty insurance, automotive and employment background verification. I enjoy solving real-world problems by designing event-driven microservices, serverless applications, and APIs that are scalable, reliable, and easy to maintain.

Over the years, Iâ€™ve reported into both software development and SRE (Site Reliability Engineering) organizations, giving me a well-rounded perspective on system design, product delivery, and platform reliability. Iâ€™m now transitioning into an Engineering Manager role, combining architectural decision-making, hands-on coding, team leadership, and strong collaboration with product and business partners in strategic analytics.

I work extensively with Java (12 years) and Python (3+ years), and have led initiatives across the full API lifecycle from requirements gathering, design, development, testing, deployment, and production support. I bring 9 years of experience working in the cloud with AWS and am currently deepening my knowledge of Microsoft Azure.

My infrastructure-as-code expertise includes 5 years with Terraform and experience with AWS CloudFormation. I also leverage GitHub Actions (2 years), AWS CodePipeline (3 years), Jenkins (5 years) to automate CI/CD pipelines, enforce testing standards, and accelerate release cycles.

On the data side, Iâ€™m currently working with SQL technologies including Databricks and Snowflake.
